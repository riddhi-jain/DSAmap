Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Approach:

1. Start traversing the tree from the root node.
2. If both the nodes p and q are in the right subtree, then continue the search with right subtree starting step 1.
3. If both the nodes p and q are in the left subtree, then continue the search with left subtree starting step 1.
4. If both step 2 and step 3 are not true, this means we have found the node which is common to node p's and q's subtrees. and hence we return this common node as the LCA.

Time complexity O(n) and space complexity O(n)

    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        parent = root.val
        p_val = p.val
        q_val = q.val
        
        if p_val > parent and q_val > parent:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        elif p_val < parent and q_val < parent:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        else:
            return root
