/*Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]. The 0s at index 5 and 10 are flipped.

Approach:
For each A[j], try to find the longest subarray.
If A[i] ~ A[j] has zeros <= K, we continue to increment j.
If A[i] ~ A[j] has zeros > K, we increment i (as well as j).

*/



int longestOnes(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        int i = 0, j;
        for (j = 0; j < A.size(); ++j) {
            if (A[j] == 0) K--;
            if (K < 0 && A[i++] == 0) K++;
        }
        return j - i;
    }
