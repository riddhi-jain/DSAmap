# **Overview**

This is a beginner-friendly project that aims to create a problem-set for various Data Structures and Algorithms. Being a programmer, practising on as many problems as possible is a must to hone your DSA knowledge. This is a try to create a repo that contains some good (basic - advanced level) questions with most efficient approaches. I aim to achieve this collaboratively, so feel free to contribute 😊

# **Guidelines to be followed:**

Whenever you solve any basic -> advance level problem, or a commonly asked one in various coding rounds of hiring process, coding challenges/practice question at any competitive programming platform, you can simultaneously be a part of [![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badges/) community 😃

**Make sure** your file name is the question title(not too long) in **CamelCase** with **single space between words**.

Each contributed file must contain the 1️⃣: **problem statement**, 2️⃣**brief explainantion of approach** and 3️⃣**most efficient (time and space) solution** in said order only.
Check [this](https://github.com/riddhi-jain/DSAmap/blob/main/Arrays/Count%20Iversions.py) as sample file.
Your solution can be in any programming language 😉

**Make sure** you generate a PR for the same data structure that relates to your problem most specifically.



# **Steps to your contiribution:**

Step-1 - Fork the repository (your own copy)

Step-2 - Create new branch (isolates your code)

Step-3 - Commit and push (add changes to your copy of repoitory)

Step-4 - Create Pull Request (contribute to the original repository)

Step-5 - Congratualtions 🎉 (thanks for your contribution 👍😃 )


Looking forward to your PR 🙃
