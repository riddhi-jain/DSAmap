'''
Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Approach:
Use a dummy head, and
l, r : define reversing range
pre, cur : used in reversing, standard reverse linked linked list method
jump : used to connect last node in previous k-group to first node in following k-group
'''



def reverseKGroup(self, head, k):
    dummy = jump = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = l = r = head
    
    while True:
        count = 0
        while r and count < k:   # use r to locate the range
            r = r.next
            count += 1
        if count == k:  # if size k satisfied, reverse the inner linked list
            pre, cur = r, l
            for _ in range(k):
                cur.next, cur, pre = pre, cur.next, cur  # standard reversing
            jump.next, jump, l = pre, l, r  # connect two k-groups
        else:
            return dummy.next
